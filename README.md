# PHP Imgur Image Reuploader

This PHP Script is a basic reuploader, here is what it does:
- User enters Image URL
- Downloads Image to local temp storage
- Uploads to Imgur via API
- Delete local temp storage Image.

# Why I created and shared this...
Please bare in mind that this project was very small and doesn't shocase my full skills. This is simply my first contribution to Github with hopefully more coming in the future.

# Temp Storage:
The Temporary storage folder is where the images are downloaded to, they are given a random name beginning with temp- then a few random numbers

# Preview
A preview is no longer available as the server was no longer being used, a preview can be provided if you need one, just contact me.

# Imgur Reuploader TinyAPI
Currently, I'm yet to finish the API for this script, as it's an API using an API, sounds strange I know :) All the API would be is a get request in the URL, something that's already built into the script, just not got a page for it yet. For now, just use host.com/imgur.php?url-http://exmaple.com/image.png
